  <h1> The SpaceX Starship System </h1>
  <i>"The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship">SpaceX Starship System</a> consist of a family of spacecraft,<br /> a super heavy booster, and a ground suppourt infrastructure."</i>
  <h2>Orbital Launches</h2>
  <p>In addition to becoming <b>the primary launch vehicle for SpaceX</b>, the Starship will be used to assist in the deployment of over 12,000 internet satellites, in conjunction with Starlink, over the next 5 years. This is just one of many intended uses for the Starship System other examples could include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Long-duration journeys beyond the earth and moon system and even into the outer planets</li>
    <li>Sending crew such as space tourist to the ISS, Lunar Gateway, and other orbital stations.</li>
    <li>The Starship <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_HLS">HLS</a> (Human Landing System) will be used to take crew and cargo to the surface and back again.</li>
    <h3>Early Starship variations</h3>
    <li>The Starship will most likely evole into a multitude of differing variations depending on how our perspective of space travel changes with time and experince. Some of the early stage planned models include:</li>
    </ul>
    <ol type="I">
      <li>Cargo Starship</li>
      <li>Tanker: Used in refueling of propellents in earth orbit.</li>
      <li>Lunar cargo lander</li>
      <li><h4>Despite all of the challenges that await man, and SpaceX alike, i feel confident that future iterations of this system could bring a renewed sense of motivation and determination that could encourage everyone to start looking up and beyond the most beautiful and complex living structure in exsistence.</h4></li>
    </ol>

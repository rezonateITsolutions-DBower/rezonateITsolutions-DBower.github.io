      <h1> The Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) </h1>
       <p> The original concept was a robtic, high performance solar eletric spacecraft that would retrieve a multi-ton boulder from an asteroid and bring it to earth orbit for study. When ARM (Asteriod Redirect Misson) was cancelled the solar electric propulsion was repurposed for Gateway.
